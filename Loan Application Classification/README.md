<h2>3. Loan Applications Classification</h2>
This repository showcases a data wrangling task focused on Loan Applications Classification using Python. The primary goal of this project is to ingest data, perform data wrangling tasks, visualize the data, and create a simple classification model using Scikit-Learn.

<h3>Project Description & Steps</h3>

Data Ingestion: Utilized Pandas to ingest raw data in various formats and structures.

Data Transformation: Handled null values, casted columns into appropriate data types, and transformed the format of columns for analysis.

Data Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various graphs for visualization, including Box plots, Count plots, and Heatmaps.

Classification Model: Utilized Scikit-Learn to create a simple classification model achieving an accuracy of 0.79.
