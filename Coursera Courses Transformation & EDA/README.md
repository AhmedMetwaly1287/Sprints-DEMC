<h2>Coursera Courses Data Transformation and EDA with PySpark</h2>
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data wrangling task focused on Coursera Courses data using PySpark. The project involves ingesting course data from a CSV file, performing aggregation functions, handling null values, creating new features for future analysis, and utilizing Spark SQL for querying and analysis.

<h3>Project Description & Steps</h3>

Data Ingestion: Utilized PySpark to ingest course data from a CSV file.

Aggregation Functions: Carried out a set of aggregation functions on the dataset to derive meaningful insights.

Null Values Handling: Implemented strategies to handle null values in the dataset.

Column Type Casting: Casted columns into appropriate data types for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Created new features/columns to facilitate future analysis.

Data Storage: Stored the transformed dataset into a file named "TransCSV".

Spark SQL: Created a temporary view of the PySpark DataFrame and wrote queries to demonstrate knowledge in Spark SQL.
